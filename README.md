# Punjabi (Gurmukhi) Language Resources

__Some Definitions:__
- Romanization: non-latin script converted into the latin script

Romanization of Gurmukhi tends to vary so just a heads up that it may be a little different in this repo from what you've seen elsewhere.

- Germination: reinforces the sound that follows i.e. k -> kk
